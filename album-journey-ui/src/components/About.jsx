            <p>
              Hi! I'm Caden Milne, a music enthusiast and developer. I used to spend hours asking 
              ChatGPT for album recommendations and manually copying them into my Apple Notes app 
              to keep track of what to listen to next. This process was tedious and didn't give me 
              the visual context I wanted to understand how albums connected to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              AlbumAI was born from this frustration - it speeds up music discovery by providing 
              instant, intelligent album recommendations with visual context about their 
              historical significance and relationships.
